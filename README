This is a Mandelbrot Set generator, written as a web service in node.js

The server part does all the rendering, including optimizations, anti-aliasing, colors etc., delivering a PNG image on demand.

A small JavaScript snippet implements the client part in the browser including point and click manipulation, zooming and choice of AA options and optimization algorithms.

All very experimental etc., play at your own risk.

Check out the live version, running on the excellent Joyent cloud at:

Also, check out my blog post including some background linked from the same URL (once it's finished :) ).

Have fun!
